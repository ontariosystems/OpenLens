# Extensions
--- 

Staring with 6.3.0 some extensions are removed from the OpenLens repository.
Currently looking into capability to package these during a build. Until then if
the version of >= 6.3.0 it would be suggested to install the [Node/Pod Menu Extension](https://github.com/alebcay/openlens-node-pod-menu) 

If need help installing extensions please see the [install extensions](https://docs.k8slens.dev/extensions/lens-extensions/#install-extensions) lens documentation.
